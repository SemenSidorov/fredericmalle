                    <h2>Perfume Designers</h2>
                    <p>Frédéric Malle and his Perfume Designers want the same things: creative freedom, access to the highest quality raw materials, and time. Together they collaborate as authors would with an editor, constantly revisiting compositions to the point of perfection, and always striving to create the modern classics of tomorrow.</p>

                         As their editor, he guides them individually through their creative process to ensure that they are always transcending their limits.</p>

                            <p>Frédéric Malle was born into a French family of industrialists, artists and perfumers. His grandfather, Serge Heftler-Louiche, founded Parfums Christian Dior before passing on its direction to Frédéric’s mother. 
                                Mr. Malle himself now represents the third generation of perfume specialists in his family and has become a world authority on perfume making.
                            </p>
                            <q>My idea was simply to put perfume
                                    back into the centre of conversation.</q>
                            <span> - FREDERIC MALLE</span>
                            <p>Mr. Malle acquired an extensive knowledge of raw materials and olfactory balance at the prestigious perfume laboratory Roure Bertrand Dupont, where he also befriended the leading perfumers of the industry. He has worked with them for over 25 years,
                                 cultivating personal relationships defined to this day by mutual trust and respect. </p>
                            <p> Confronted with the imminent disappearance of the perfume trade, Frédéric Malle went back to what perfumery used to be and to what it could be again in our modern context: a trade in which a perfume is the result of total creative freedom, liberated from the pressure of marketing strategies and deadlines. In essence, a return to the nurture of quality,
                                 something he felt was slipping through the fingers of the luxury industry. </p>
