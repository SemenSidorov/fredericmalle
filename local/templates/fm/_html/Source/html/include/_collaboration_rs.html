        <p class="collaboration__text">Ralf Schwieger once took part in a perfume contest that Frédéric Malle had staged for young perfumers.

            Having spent his childhood in Germany exploring forests and absorbing all of their unusual smells, Ralf Schwieger is prone to creating perfumes with unexpected personalities.

His perfumes, as a result, are both cerebral and intuitive.</p>
