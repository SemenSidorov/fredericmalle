            <p>Frédéric Malle and his Perfume Designers want the same things: creative freedom, access to the highest quality raw materials, and time. Together they collaborate as authors would with an editor, constantly revisiting compositions to the point of perfection, and always striving
                to create the modern classics of tomorrow.Dominique Ropion is a daring perfectionist, a true inventor.</p>
            <q>A good perfume, he likes to say, must always be at once excessive</q>
            <span> – Dominique Ropion</span>
            <p>The risks he takes are invariably accompanied by a relentless pursuit of exact olfactory balance and flawless composition. His perfumes are like great architectural feats: in the same way that a bridge,
                whose seemingly miraculous suspension of weight is in fact a harnessing of counteracting forces.</p>
            <p>Dominique Ropion often balances excessive doses of powerful ingredients with meticulously measured, subtler accords, until the composition holds up on its own. A good perfume,
                he likes to say, must always be at once excessive and harmonious.</p>
