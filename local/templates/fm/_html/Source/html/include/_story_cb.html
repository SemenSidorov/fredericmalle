            <p class="story__text">Carlos Benaïm is considered to be America’s greatest living perfumer. As the author of the legendary perfume Polo Ralph Lauren and of many other beloved classics, he owes his success to a great intellectual curiosity that has always pushed him to embrace a world beyond the boundaries of perfume making.</p>
            <p class="story__text">He discovered perfumery as a child through his father, who was a pharmacist in Morocco and had a passion for extracting essential oils. “Every summer,” Carlos Benaïm remembers: “my father and I would drive our Jeep through the countryside, in and out of picking and distillation spots, and I would feel his enthusiasm intensifying." He later acquired a deep knowledge of perfume composition under the tutelage of the renowned American perfumer Ernest Shiftan.</p>
