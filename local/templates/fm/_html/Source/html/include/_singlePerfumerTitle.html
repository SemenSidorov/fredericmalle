        <p>Frédéric Malle and his Perfume Designers want the same things: creative freedom, access to the highest quality raw materials, and time. Together they collaborate as authors would with an editor, constantly revisiting compositions to the point of perfection, and always striving to create the modern classics of tomorrow.</p>
