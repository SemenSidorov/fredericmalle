            <p class="story__text">Fanny Bal is a force of nature. As Dominique Ropion’s apprentice, she has access to the finest raw materials in the industry and some of its best-kept secrets; and yet, she is constantly surprising her seniors, first at ISIPCA, then at IFF, with her own independent initiatives and rigorous experimentation, both testaments to her flourishing talent. She has shown everyone, including Frédéric Malle, that she is a young perfumer to be reckoned with. Dominique Ropion has said of his pupil that, “curious, tenacious and bold” in both her approach to perfume and as a person, Fanny Bal possesses “all the best qualities to become a great perfumer”.</p>
