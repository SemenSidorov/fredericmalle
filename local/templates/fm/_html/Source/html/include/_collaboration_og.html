        <p class="collaboration__text">Olivia Giacobetti has an uncanny ability to create an atmosphere. Having completed her training at Robertet, she founded her own perfume laboratory, Iska, and dedicated her career to doing precisely that. She is the brains and the nose behind the fig accords that have been present in home scents for years. </p>

        <p class="collaboration__text">The perfumes that move her most are “echoes of everyday life and nature: fleeting emotions, moods, details, attitudes… the many small fragments of life that bear new images”. Her compositions capture the authenticity of a single moment. They are, in other words, odes to transience.</p>
