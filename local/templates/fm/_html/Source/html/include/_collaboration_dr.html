        <p class="collaboration__text">Dominique Ropion is a daring perfectionist, a true inventor. 
            The risks he takes are invariably accompanied by a relentless pursuit of exact olfactory balance and flawless composition. 
            A good perfume, he likes to say, must always be at once excessive and harmonious.</p>
        <p class="collaboration-item__title">The Publisher</p>
        <p class="collaboration__text">	His perfumes are like great architectural feats: in the same way that a bridge,
             whose seemingly miraculous suspension of weight is in fact a harnessing of counteracting forces, 
             Dominique often balances excessive doses of powerful ingredients with meticulously measured, subtler accords,
             until the composition holds up on its own.</p>
