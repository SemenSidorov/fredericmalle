            <p class="story__text">Michel Roudnitska spent his childhood exploring his parents’ laboratory, where perfume became his mother tongue. He was initiated by his father, the illustrious Edmond Roudnitska, into the art of perfume composition. Later, he broadened his artistic horizons by becoming a photographer and a director. He joined his parent’s lab Art & Parfum in 1997, where he creates perfumes with great aesthetic rigor. Michel Roudnitska, like his father before him, has always considered perfume making to be an art. His style is continually informed by his many travels around the world.</p>
