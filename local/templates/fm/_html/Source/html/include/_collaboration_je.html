        <p class="collaboration__text">As a disciple and close friend of the legendary Edmond Roudnitska (creator of Le Parfum de Thérèse), Jean-Claude Ellena developed, over the years, a unique minimalistic approach to perfumery. This distinctive style, which is continually informed by his elegant and quiet way of being, has been compared to watercolor sketches and chamber music. Ellena says that a perfume must be like “a soft caress; nothing must shock, nothing must shout.” Edmond Roudnitska’s minimalism never left him, however, and his compositions remain focused around a few ingredients, avoiding repetition.</p>

        <p class="collaboration__text">	Jean-Claude Ellena was born in Grasse into a family of perfumers. His training began at age 17, in the most prestigious laboratories – in Grasse, Paris, New York and Geneva – where he always saw himself as self-taught. He met Frédéric Malle at Givaudan Roure when he was working on Bulgari’s Eau au Thé Vert. He composed one perfume a year for Editions de Parfums before joining Hermès.</p>
